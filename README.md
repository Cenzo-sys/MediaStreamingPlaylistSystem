# MediaStreamingPlaylistSystem
Java console app simulating a media streaming system. Demonstrating OOP, comparators, data export, and TDD principles.
# Media Streaming Playlist System (Java, OOP)

A **Java-based console application** that simulates a simplified **media streaming platform** for managing podcasts, categories, and playlists.  
Developed as part of coursework to demonstrate **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **modular design**, and **data handling** in Java.

---

## Features
- **Category Management** – Create and organize podcast categories using encapsulated class structures.  
- **Sorting & Comparison** – Custom comparator (`CompareID`) used to sort items dynamically.  
- **Data Export** – Export data in a structured format (`exportLongForm.java`).  
- **Scalable System Design** – Core logic centralized in `MediaStreamingPlaylistSystem.java` for modularity and reuse.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction across multiple classes.
  - Composition between objects such as Podcasts and Categories.
- **Interfaces & Comparators**
  - Custom sorting using `Comparator` with `@Override` methods.
- **File Handling**
  - Exporting formatted text to external files.
- **Test-Driven Development**
  - Early application of **JUnit** testing to ensure correctness and maintainability.
